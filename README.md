# ImageRankingCV

An image ranking algorithm, that uses a pre-trained deep neural network  called Stable Diffusion XL to generate high quality images based on text prompts. Computation power for training and inference is generated using NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Advanced computer vision metrics like Structural similarity index(SSIM) and Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are used evaluate the generated images and weighted average of these metrics is used for ranking.
